### Patterns

Classical GOF Design Patterns in Java

![alt text](patterns.png "Design Patterns")

### Creational

* Abstract Factory: Creates an instance of several families of classes
* Builder: Separates object construction from its representation
* Factory Method: Creates an instance of several derived classes
* Prototype: A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
* Singleton: A class of which only a single instance can exist

### Structural

* Adapter: Match interfaces of different classes
* Bridge: Separates an object's interface from its implementation
* Composite: A tree structure of simple and composite objects
* Decorator: Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
* Facade: A single class that represents an entire subsystem
* Flyweight: A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
* Proxy: An object representing another object

### Behavioral

* Chain of responsibility: A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
* Command: Encapsulate a command request as an object
* Interpreter: A way to include language elements in a program
* Iterator: Sequentially access the elements of a collection
* Mediator: Defines simplified communication between classes
* Memento: Capture and restore an object's internal state
* Observer: A way of notifying change to a number of classes
* State: Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
* Strategy: Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
* Template method: Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
* Visitor: Defines a new operation to a class without change

### Build 
```bash
./mvnw clean install 
```
